# E-skeleton-web


E-skeleton-web is a vue template that will deploy in seconds a single page application running on a docker container that will let you connect it to other E-skeleton projects with a simple command

You can search more of my E-skeletons docker projects and try to combine them in order to create a complete backend for your apps.
  - iOs_E-skeleton
  - E-skeleton-login
  - E-skeleton-Api

### Tech

E-skeleton-web uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Vue.js] - Evented I/O for the backend
* [Babel] - A next generation JavaScript compiler
* [Axios] - Promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript 
* [Vuetify] - Vue UI Library with beautifully handcrafted Material Components.

### Installation

E-skeleton-web requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run.

If you have Node already installed in your pc, then proceed with this commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/headStyleColorRed/e-skeleton-web.git
$ cd E-skeleton-web
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
